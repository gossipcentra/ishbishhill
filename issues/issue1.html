  <main>
    <p>Once upon a time, 597,975 years ago there was the creation of Hill, skrjskrjskrj (aka: ish bish hill) in the year 1809 ish bish had a idea to create demon babies to possess some random teenagers. First to be created was (ps each baby demon is powered by a dead person from the time) the first to be created was Bonjamino trallelero when he died from temmas murder he was renamed (bubblegum ish bish 1809). Temma died when her bf killed her because she killed bonjamino because he was secretly in love. Temma died in 1815 (chocolate ish bish). [TIME JUMP] Olipsis, chartel, and julieca where in a forest doing a seance when ish bish the og sent bubblegum and chocolate to be summoned and murder them. Olipsis dies first by a falling metal tube in 1867 then chartel died in 1871 by a freaky tree lightning accident, and finally julieca dies in 1899 surrounded by her grand children when she is crushed by a church.(She goes to church to keep away the demons) so now all the Demons (hill, bubblegum, chocolate, otpliniss, babadook, kelly) live in little statues and when a chant is said you can swap places with the demon. 2025, ish bish hill is the first to rise. All the other bodies decomposed so now she's looking for more humans </p>
